**Letâ€™s face it: learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript is pretty hard.** Part of the reason is that these languages have some inherent characteristics that make it very hard for beginners to begin their journey. 

Weird syntax (e.g. atob vs getElementsByClassName), ambiguity (e.g. innerText vs textContent), a multitude of ways to do the same thing (e.g. onclick, addEventListener, event attributes) and other aspects of the computer languages and tools involved are some examples of the obstacles faced by newcomers. 

Training Wheels provide beginner-friendly alternatives for most of these cases as well as best practices that will let beginners avoid common mistakes and help them become better programmers right from the start.
